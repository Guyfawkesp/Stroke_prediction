# Stroke Prediction using Machine Learning

## Research Question  
**Can we accurately predict the likelihood of a patient experiencing a stroke based on health and lifestyle factors using machine learning?**

## Expected Data Source(s)  
The dataset will be sourced from a publicly available stroke prediction dataset, which includes patient demographic and health information such as age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, smoking status, and more.

## Techniques Expected to Use in the Analysis

- **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning**  
  Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Identifying key trends, correlations, and patterns in the data.

- **Feature Selection**  
  Determining the most significant predictors of stroke.

- **Machine Learning Models**  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Random Forest  
  - Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

- **Model Evaluation**  
  Using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate performance.

## Expected Results  
We aim to develop a predictive model capable of identifying patients at high risk of stroke with reasonable accuracy. The project will also reveal the most influential factors contributing to stroke, such as age, hypertension, heart disease, and smoking status.

## Why This Question Is Important  
Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide, responsible for approximately 11% of all deaths (World Health Organization). Early detection is critical, but healthcare providers often lack accessible, data-driven tools to assess stroke risk based on routine patient data.  
This project seeks to fill that gap by creating a predictive model that supports early identification of high-risk individuals. The resulting insights can guide timely medical intervention, ultimately helping to prevent severe outcomes and save lives through smarter, data-informed healthcare decisions.
