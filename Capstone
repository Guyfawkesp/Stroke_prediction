Research Question:
Can we accurately predict the likelihood of a patient experiencing a stroke based on health and lifestyle factors using machine learning?

Expected Data Source(s):
The dataset will be sourced from a publicly Links to an external site.available stroke prediction dataset, which includes patient demographic and health information, as described above.

Techniques Expected to Use in the Analysis:

Data preprocessing and cleaning (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, etc.)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key trends and correlations

Feature selection to identify the most significant predictors of stroke

Machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVC

Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall 

Expected Results:
I expect to develop a predictive model that can identify patients at high risk of stroke with reasonable accuracy. The results will highlight the most influential factors contributing to stroke, such as age, hypertension, heart disease, and smoking status.

Why This Question Is Important:
Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide, responsible for about 11% of all deaths (WHO). Early detection is key, but healthcare providers often lack simple tools to assess stroke risk from routine data. This project aims to fill that gap by building a predictive model to identify high-risk patients early. The insights can support timely intervention and help prevent serious outcomesâ€”potentially saving lives through smarter, data-driven decisions.
